# A Project in continuous improvement

I'm already used to VueJS and I'm new to React. I took a ready-made project, made changes and will use it as a study. My goal is to continually improve it to the most advanced state possible for a tic-tac-toe game.

### Who am I ? 

My name is Matheus Passos. I'm 20 years old and I'm a fullstack software development intern. I'm looking for continuous improvement and that's why I chose to learn the most requested technologies in the market, such as React.
At the time of this Readme update, I have solid experiences with Java, VueJS, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, Cordova and other frameworks. Also, I worked with Linux and Docker.
I hope this simple project becomes something more advanced and that you can follow my evolution!
